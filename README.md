Conway's Game of Life using Open MPI.

In order for this program to work correctly follow the following steps:

1. Compile and run the initital_image.c file to create and initial image.

2. Compile and run the MPI_gameoflife.c file to create the desired slides.

3. Compile and run EITHER readserial.c OR readserial_curses.c to read the 
   'images' file for the slide show. readserial_curses.c uses the curses 
   library to show a more pleasant slide show.
